# Custom Hooks, When, Why and How?
For Reusablity, Redability, Maintainbility, Testablity and Sepration of Concerns
At the end of day its just a function.
We use hook just to export some code from our component to somewhere so that i can use that somewhere else also in my code just like a function

# Chunking
# Code Splitting
# Dynamic Bundling
# Lazy Loading
# On Demand Loading
When we build a huge app then it is not a wise idea to throw all the code to user browser instead of that we can throw the code which user asked by doing Bundling. if we make entire code run on user computer it can make app run slower

When we try to load on demand react suspend that component

on image heavy website we can put that images on CDN and i can compress that i can cache that
